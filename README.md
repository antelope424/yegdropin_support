## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why is a drop-in session showing incorrectly?
YEG Drop-in aggregates data from the City of Edmonton's recreation platforms, but schedules are subject to change without notice by the facilities. Please verify with the facility directly for guaranteed accuracy.

### Proximity sorting isn't working for me.
Ensure that you have granted YEG Drop-in location permissions in your device's privacy settings. The app requires your current location to calculate distances to nearby facilities.

### How do the reminders work?
When you click "Remind Me" on a session, the app schedules a local push notification on your device. Please note that if a session is suddenly cancelled *after* you set the reminder, the app may not notify you of the cancellation unless you open the app to refresh the live schedule.
