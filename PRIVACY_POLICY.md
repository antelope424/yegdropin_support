# Privacy Policy for YEG Drop-in

**Effective Date**: February 20, 2026

YEG Drop-in ("we," "us," or "our") is a non-profit, community utility application designed to help residents of Edmonton find recreation schedules. 

## 1. Data We Collect
- **Location Data**: If you grant permission, we use your device's GPS location to calculate the distance to recreation facilities and sort the "Starting Soon" list by proximity. This data is processed locally on your device and is never stored on our servers.
- **Device Identifiers**: We use Firebase App Check, which may collect certain device identifiers (like IP address or hardware IDs) to verify that requests to our server are coming from the authentic YEG Drop-in application. This is used solely for security and abuse prevention.
- **Usage & Crash Data**: If you explicitly opt-in via the app settings, we collect anonymous usage analytics (such as screen views and feature usage) and crash reports using Firebase to improve app stability and performance.

## 2. Data Usage
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We do not use tracking cookies or third-party advertising identifiers.

## 3. Storage
All your app preferences (Favorites, Notifications, Cached Schedules, and Config) are stored locally on your device using Hive encryption. We do not maintain user accounts or cloud profiles.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We use **Google Cloud** and **Firebase** to host our data and secure our API. These services may process data in accordance with their own privacy policies. We also use **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)** to serve interstitial and banner advertisements.
